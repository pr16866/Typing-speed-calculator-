Cows are female cattle, and their male counterparts are known as a bull. They are domestic, bovine animals that feed on plants. The average size and color of a cow depending on its type of breed. There are many breeds of cows. Some of which are more popular like Jersey. The milk-producing capacity of cows is also dependent on its type of breed.\",\r\n  \"Larger cows produce more milk, but it is not always true. Cows have excellent grazing capabilities. Due to this, certain protected grasslands have been declared as anti-grazing zones. Adult cows have a set of 32 teeth. There are no upper-level incisors’ or canines in a mature cow. Their teeth have smooth surfaces with moon-shaped ridges that have been specially designed for an herbivorous lifestyle. Cows chew their food all the time. They can even take it out from their gut to chew it again properly.\",\r\n  \"According to the Ramayana, Diwali is the day of the return of Rama. This day Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya along with his wife Sita. This return was made after Rama defeated demon King Ravana. Furthermore, Rama’s brother Lakshmana and Hanuman also came back to Ayodhya victorious\",\r\n  \"The religious significance of this festival has differences. It varies from one region to another in India. There is an association of many deities, cultures, and traditions with Diwali. The reason for these differences is probably local harvest festivals. Hence, there was a fusion of these harvest festivals into one pan-Hindu festival.\",\r\n  \"First of all, understand that India is the land of festivals. However, none of the festivals comes close to Diwali. It is certainly one of the biggest festivals in India. It is probably the brightest festival in the world.

It is known as the festival of lights\",\r\n  \"Feminism is a social and political movement that advocates for the rights of women on the grounds of equality of sexes. It does not deny the biological differences between the sexes but demands equality in opportunities. It covers everything from social and political to economic arenas. In fact, feminist campaigns have been a crucial part of history in women empowerment.\",\r\n  \"Feminism is not just important for women but for every sex, gender, caste, creed and more. It empowers the people and society as a whole. A very common misconception is that only women can be feminists.\",\r\n\r\n  \"It is absolutely wrong but feminism does not just benefit women. It strives for equality of the sexes, not the superiority of women. Feminism takes the gender roles which have been around for many years and tries to deconstruct them.

But, it is also important to remember that kindness towards you is also essential for personal growth.Kindness is basically being polite, compassionate and thoughtful. Every religion and faith teaches its followers to be kind. Most importantly, kindness must not limit to humans but also to every living creature.Even nature has its own way of showing kindness. For instance, the trees grow fruits for us and provide us with shade. One must not see kindness as a core value but as a fundamental behavioural element Experts are debating on this topic for years. Also, the technology covered a long way to make human life easier but the negative aspect of it can’t be ignored. Over the years technological advancement has caused a severe rise in pollution. Also, pollution has become a major cause of many health issues\",\r\n  \"There is no doubt that kindness always wins and it has been proven time and again by people. Sid is a greedy man who does not share his wealth with anyone, not even his family members. He also does not pay his workers well. One day, he loses his bag of gold coins and loses his temper. Everyone helps him out to search for it but no one finds it. Finally, his worker’s little son finds the bag. Upon checking the bag, he sees all the coins are there. But, his greed makes him play a trick on the poor worker. He claims that there were more coins in the bag and the worker stole them. The issue goes to the court and the judge confirms from Sid whether his bag had more coins to which he agrees Regularly evolving technology has become an important part of our lives.

The first one is that natural resources deplete at a faster level. Our planet can produce only a limited amount of water and food. Thus, overpopulation causes environmental damage including deforestation, pollution, etc. Similarly, there is the degradation of the environment which happens because of the overuse of resources like coal, oil, natural gases and more. As a result, the quality of air also gets affected in this manner. As they are completely different fields but they are interdependent on each other. Also, it is due to science contribution we can create new innovation and build new technological tools. Apart from that, the research conducted in laboratories contributes a lot to the development of technologies. On the other hand, technology extends the agenda of science. With new technology the industrialization increases which give birth to many pollutions like air, water, soil, and noise. Also, they cause many health-related issues in animals, birds, and human beings\",\r\n  \"In developing countries, overpopulation puts a strain on resources. Thus, it gives rise to conflicts and tension. It also causes more diseases that become harder to control. Next up, we have the issue of unemployment. Moreover, it rises due to overpopulation. There is more number of people than job opportunities. As a result, unemployment gives rise to crimes like theft and more. We also have pandemics and epidemics which happen due to overpopulation. It is because overcrowded and unhygienic living gives rise to infectious diseases. Another ill-effect is malnutrition and starvation. Essay topics in English can be difficult to come up with.
