Their teeth have smooth surfaces with moon-shaped ridges that have been specially designed for an herbivorous lifestyle. Cows chew their food all the time.

Every religion and faith teaches its followers to be kind. Most importantly, kindness must not limit to humans but also to every living creature.Even nature has its own way of showing kindness. For instance, the trees grow fruits for us and provide us with shade. One must not see kindness as a core value but as a fundamental behavioural element Experts are debating on this topic for years.

Everyone helps him out to search for it but no one finds it. Finally, his worker’s little son finds the bag. Upon checking the bag, he sees all the coins are there. But, his greed makes him play a trick on the poor worker. He claims that there were more coins in the bag and the worker stole them. The issue goes to the court and the judge confirms from Sid whether his bag had more coins to which he agrees Regularly evolving technology has become an important part of our lives.

Thus, overpopulation causes environmental damage including deforestation, pollution, etc. Similarly, there is the degradation of the environment which happens because of the overuse of resources like coal, oil, natural gases and more. As a result, the quality of air also gets affected in this manner. As they are completely different fields but they are interdependent on each other. Also, it is due to science contribution we can create new innovation and build new technological tools. Apart from that, the research conducted in laboratories contributes a lot to the development of technologies. On the other hand, technology extends the agenda of science. With new technology the industrialization increases which give birth to many pollutions like air, water, soil, and noise. Also, they cause many health-related issues in animals, birds, and human beings\",\r\n  \"In developing countries, overpopulation puts a strain on resources. Thus, it gives rise to conflicts and tension. It also causes more diseases that become harder to control. Next up, we have the issue of unemployment. Moreover, it rises due to overpopulation. There is more number of people than job opportunities. As a result, unemployment gives rise to crimes like theft and more. We also have pandemics and epidemics which happen due to overpopulation. It is because overcrowded and unhygienic living gives rise to infectious diseases. Another ill-effect is malnutrition and starvation. Essay topics in English can be difficult to come up with.
